                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>My name is Corrine Nightingale (she/her) and I am a Professional Counselor Associate and Clinical Rehabilitation 
                Counselor (CRC) registered in the state of Oregon. I am also a National Certified Counselor (NCC). I believe 
                acknowledging our identities (the core parts that make you, you!) is important to the counseling relationship. My salient
                identities include being a cisgender, biracial Chamoru, and queer woman of color, a cozy games enthusiast, and a lover of 
                animated shows/movies.</p>

                <h2>Counseling Style</h2>
                <p>My counseling approach focuses on person-centered and trauma-informed care through a social justice lens. I follow the
                10 principles of disability justice and integrate themes of wholeness, anti-capitalism, intersectionality, collectivism,
                and advocacy in my practice. My theoretical orientation draws from existential-humanistic and relational cultural
                therapies, which means I am interested in exploring how your perspectives, identities, and relationships influence
                your experience.</p>

                <p>I believe that effective therapy requires a collaborative relationship between the therapist and the client with a 
                foundation of trust, non-judgment, empathy, and consent. I believe that you are the expert on your own experience and 
                that your identities, values, and resilience greatly informs the healing process.</p>

                <h2>Fees and Services</h2>

                <p>I currently offer 50-minute individual counseling sessions Monday through Wednesday via telehealth only. 
                I have a limited number of pro-bono and sliding scale spots reserved. If my sliding scale spots are full, 
                I am happy to refer you to other clinicians who may be able to offer a reduced rate. I am passionate about 
                getting folks connected with accessible and affordable mental health services. Clients who are able to pay 
                my full rate make it possible for me to offer sliding scale options for community members who cannot afford
                my full rate.</p>

                <p>Clients must be located in the state of Oregon. Currently telehealth only.</p>

                <p><strong>Individual Counseling Rate:<strong> $120 - $175 for 50 minutes.</p>
                <p><strong>Intake Sessions:</strong> $150 - $175 for 75 minutes.</p>
